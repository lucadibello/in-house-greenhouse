## **1 Problem description**

The use of agricultural fields is fundamental for the production of primary goods necessary for human beings, but this involves numerous quantities of carbon used in the transport of the goods themselves in department stores or shops. These quantities of carbon are then released into the air in the form of greenhouse gases by means of transport and these actions, like other human actions, contribute to global warming.

## **2 Our solution**

**In-House Greenhouse** let you control your smart greenhouse via your smartphone wherever you are in the world. Never ask a friend to water your plant again!

This smart greenhouse allows you to fully manage up to 6 plants, providing water and collecting useful information such as soil moisture and air temperature.

The collected data is used to show statistics about the growth of your plants and to alert you in case of problems on one or more plants in your in-house greenhouse. These data can be shared between friends, so that you can compare your statistics with them.

## **3 System architecture**

This is a small diagram showing all the components that make up the **In-House Greenhouse** system:

![System Architecture](/extra/schemas/system-architecture/system-architecture.png)

This is a small diagram showing all the components that make up the In-House Greenhouse system. The Greenhouse collects data about the state of the plants and the surrounding environment via sensors, and then sends this data to the server via HTTP calls to the API, which will save the data within the PostgreSQL database.

The phone application is strictly dependent on the API.  The data shown in the various interfaces, such as the list of added greenhouses, statistics of the various plants, etc. are read dynamically via HTTP requests sent to the API. The user through the phone application as well as view the data in the DB can also modify them: it is possible to change the information of any greenhouse and any plant owned by the user.

The core of the application, the APIs, are runnning inside a Docker container (also the database they are connected to). The use of a container offers several potentialities to the product such as great scalability (being able to dynamically increase the number of API containers if the main container is overloaded). Through Docker-Compose it is easy to start the entire application on any platform without any additional configuration.

## **4 Tech stack**

This chapter describes the technologies and languages used to program/set up every single component of the system (the icons refer to those in the *System architecture* chapter).

### **4.2 In-House Greenhouse App**

The application is developed with React Native and Expo using the TypeScript language. The application also uses *Ui Kitten* as a UI framework.

### **4.3 In-House Greenhouse**

The physical greenhouse offers a variety of sensors, which are used by a Raspberry Pi to collect useful data about the plants and the environment, for example, humidity level, air temperature, and soil moisture.

The data collected allows the greenhouse to take care of each individual plant according to its needs.  

The system for collecting and managing sensor data is written in Python.

### **4.4 API and database with Docker**

The API is implemented using GraphQL with the TypeScript language. GraphQL is an API query language that allows the developer to request exactly the data needed.

In addition, the API takes care of data management and communication between Greenhouse and the SmartPhone application. The communication is done via HTTP requests (custom created for each operation) sent server. Check out the API documentation for more detailed information.

## **5 Development**

### **5.1 Server**

The server is based on 3 principals models: user, greenhouse, plant.

The 3 models save some informations for the app, of which few of them are the same for all the 3 models, mainly 3: id, date's creation, date's updating. In the case of the id, it is incremented at each new user that we register, while in the case of date, it is managed by a function that it gives the date in that instant of the creation or updating.

In the user's model we save others 4 informations: email, name, surname, password. While the greenhouse's model is structured with 4 informations: name, description, plants, isOkay. The isOkay's component is a boolean's type, that is used as a "flag", that tell to the user, that the Greenhouse needs attention. While the description's component is a part that the user can use to give some informations about his Greenhouse. Instead the plant component represents the set of plants that the "greenhouse" has inside.

In the case plant's model there are others 5 informations: name, description, greenhouse, greenhouseId, isDeleted. The greenhouse's component is used to hold the reference of the greenhouse, in which the plant is planted. While the isDeleted's component is a "flag" that says if the plant is deleted or not.

The 3 models are managed by Query via API, where they allow the creation and the possibility of having a list of users, or greenhouses, or plants. Furthermore, for plants, it is also possible to insert a plant in the greenhouse, clearly all these functions are allowed with the help of GraphQL.

### **5.2 App**

The app shows information about the greenhouse and plants (greenhouse-app\app\components). The part relating to the greenhouse reports the number of plants planted and the state itself, so if it needs control (red color) or if everything is ok (green color) (greenhouse-app\app\components\greenhouse-card.tsx), in addition you can see the list of greenhouses (greenhouse-app\app\components\greenhouse-list.tsx). While for what concerns the plant it is shown: the life time (calculated), the date on which the plant was planted, and the percentage of soil moisture (greenhouse-app\app\components\plant-card.tsx).

The navigation within the app is combined within the navigator (greenhouse-app\app\navigators), where there are the switch tabs, which are used for the homepage to the other pages, such as for example to that of the settings. Furthermore, inside there is also the stack, where all the screens are inserted, such as: the greenhouse, the add plant, the plant modification.

The plant screen takes care of loading the greenhouse to which you want to add the plant and showing its information, after which it asks for the name of the plant and a description. Finally, after the data collection, it checks them and if they go well they are saved through an API. Furthermore, the screen offers the possibility to modify the plant, where it also takes care of reloading the greenhouse and showing its information, and as regards the plant to be modified, some information is shown: name of the plant, description of the plant, date of creation of the plant, date of the last modification       (greenhouse-app\app\screens). The screen of the greenhouse takes care of showing the information and giving the possibility, by means of a button, to remove the plant and to save the changes applied to the greenhouse itself. Finally the homepage screen takes care of reloading all registered greenhouses.

**//need to write the part of screen's setting//**

As for the appâ€™s memory, you can save the greenhouse, remove the plant from the database and from the state tree (greenhouse-app\app\models\greenhouse-store).
