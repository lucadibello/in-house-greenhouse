# 1 Description of the problem
<br>
The use of agricultural fields is fundamental for the production of primary goods necessary for human beings, but this involves numerous quantities of carbon used in the transport of the goods themselves in department stores or shops. These quantities of carbon are then released into the air in the form of greenhouse gases by means of transport and these actions, like other human actions, contribute to global warming.

# 2 Introduction
<br>
In-House Greenhouse allows you to manage your "small" greenhouse wherever you are, at work, at the doctor, to find relatives in another country.. It works through an app which manages 6 plants through the collection information, such as: temperature of the surrounding area, soil moisture. Thanks to the collection of information, the application is able to show statistics on plants and if it deems it necessary it warns of a possible problem that a plant encounters. The In-House Greenhouse also allows you to have the statistics of your friends' "small greenhouses", and therefore to make real comparisons as farmers would do with their land trying to exchange opinions.
